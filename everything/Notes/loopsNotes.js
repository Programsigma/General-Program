/* loops are a great way for us to repeat a set of steps.
If you have something you want to do multiple times in a row,
 or until something happens, loops are an ideal solution

 Two types of loops
 -While loops
 -For loops

 While loops:
 while(condition) {
    // code goes here
 }

 code will repeat as long as the condition is true.

 ex:  */
 let i = 0;
 while (i<3){
    console.log(i);
    i++; // shorthand for i += 1, a shorthand for i=i+1
 }
